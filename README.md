**CityFix** is a modern, full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal authorities. It provides a seamless platform for users to report local civic problems‚Äîlike potholes, broken streetlights, or overflowing bins‚Äîand an intuitive dashboard for administrators to manage, prioritize, and track these issues to resolution.

## üìù Implementation Notes

This section provides additional details about the implementation and architecture of the application.

-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is built using a modular, component-based structure in React. Key components like `AdminDashboard`, `ReportIssueModal`, and `IssueDetailModal` are designed to be self-contained and reusable.
-   **State Management:** For simplicity and ease of maintenance, the application primarily uses React's built-in state management hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`). For more complex state logic, `useCallback` is used to optimize performance by memoizing functions.
-   **Mock Data:** The current version operates using static mock data (`initialIssues`) to simulate a backend and allow for rapid UI development. In a production environment, this would be replaced with API calls to a dedicated backend service.
-   **API Integration:** The "Report Issue" modal demonstrates integration with the Google Maps Geocoding API to fetch addresses from GPS coordinates and vice-versa. This serves as a template for future backend integrations.

### Extra Features & Optimizations

-   **Responsive Design:** The entire application, from the user reporting form to the admin dashboard, is fully responsive and designed to provide an optimal experience on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
-   **Engaging UI/UX:** Fluid animations powered by **Framer Motion** are used throughout the app to enhance user interactions, such as modal pop-ups and list rendering. This creates a more polished and engaging user experience.
-   **Dynamic Map Previews:** The admin dashboard modal includes an interactive Google Maps preview for each issue, providing immediate geographical context without needing to leave the page.
-   **Optimized Image Handling:** The image uploader in the reporting modal generates instant client-side previews and handles multiple file uploads gracefully, providing a smooth user experience.
